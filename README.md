## Task 2 Instructions
In Task 1, you created a proposal for a capstone project composed of several parts. In this task, you will propose the software product for the topic approved in Task 1. You will describe a business problem or opportunity and the software development life cycle used, justify the programming environments included in the development, and explain how the testing for the software solution will be accomplished. 

You will compile the information for your software product into a report based on the prompts in the Requirements section. This report will help you in the next task to develop and test your software product. 

All the requirements below are covered in template 2 with instructions.
A.  Describe the business problem or opportunity, including the challenge customers encounter, and how the proposed software product will fulfill customer needs.
 

B.  Describe the software development life cycle methodology you will use to guide and support software development activities.

1.  Describe the deliverables associated with each phase of the applied software development life cycle methodology.

2.  Describe the development plan for your software product, including the anticipated outcomes from development.

3.  Develop a projected timeline, including milestones, start and end dates, duration for each milestone, dependencies, and resources assigned to each activity.
 

C.  Justify the programming environments included in the development of the software product, including the following:

●  any related costs

●  the human resources that are necessary to execute each task
 

D.  Explain how the proposed software product will be tested by doing the following:

1.  Justify the methods for validating and verifying that the developed software product will meet customer needs.

2.  Explain how your test results will be analyzed.
 

E.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
 

F.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.

## Task 3 Instructions
In the previous task, you identified a business problem or opportunity and proposed a software product to address customer needs. In this task, you will further expand on the software product you proposed in Task 2 by developing and testing a full stack software product, as well as associated documentation. You will also submit a Panopto recording demonstrating your software product’s functionality and the tools used in development.

Your work for this task will not be evaluated until Task 2 has been submitted and passed.

In this task, you'll need to complete the following steps:

Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc., unless specified in the task requirements. All other submissions must be file types that are uploaded and submitted as attachments (e.g., .docx, .pdf, .ppt).
 

A.  Create your subgroup and project by logging into GitLab using the web link provided and using the “GitLab How-To” web link, and do the following:

●  Clone the project to the IDE.

●  Commit with a message and push when you complete each of the tasks listed below (e.g., parts B to E).



Note: You may commit and push whenever you want to back up your changes, even if a task is not complete.



●  Submit a copy of the GitLab repository URL and a copy of the repository branch history retrieved from your repository, which must include the commit messages and dates.
 

Note: Wait until you have completed all the following prompts before you create your copy of the repository branch history.
 

B.  Design and develop a fully functional full stack (mobile or web) software product that addresses your identified business problem or organizational need. Include each of the following attributes, as they are the minimum required elements for the application:

●  code including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation

●  search functionality with multiple row results and displays

●  a database component with the functionality to securely add, modify, and delete the data

●  ability to generate reports with multiple columns, multiple rows, date-time stamps, and title

●  validation functionality

●  industry-appropriate security features

●  design elements that make the application scalable

●  a user-friendly, functional GUI
 

C.  Create each of the following forms of documentation for the software product you have developed:

●  a design document including a class diagram and design diagram

●  link to where the web app is hosted with HTML code (if applicable)

●  link to the GitLab repository of the code indicating the version included in this submission

●  user guide for setting up and running the application for maintenance purposes

●  user guide for running the application from a user perspective
 

D.  Explain how the software product was tested, including the following:

●  a test plan for a unit test, including screenshots

●  unit test scripts

●  the results of the unit tests based on the provided test plan, including screenshots

●  summaries of changes resulting from completed tests
 

E.  Provide a Panopto video recording that includes a demonstration of the functionality of the software application and a summary of the tool or tools used.
 

Note: For instructions on how to access and use Panopto, use the "Panopto How-To Videos" web link provided in the instructions of the course of study in the task details of task 3. To access Panopto's website, navigate to the web link titled "Panopto Access" and then choose to log in using the “WGU” option. If prompted, log in using your WGU student portal credentials, and then it will forward you to Panopto’s website.

To submit your recording, upload it to the Panopto drop box titled Software Engineering Capstone EQN1 | D424 (Student Creators).” Once the recording has been uploaded and processed in Panopto's system, retrieve the URL of the recording from Panopto and copy and paste it into the Links option. Upload the remaining task requirements using the Attachments option.
 

F.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
 

G.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
